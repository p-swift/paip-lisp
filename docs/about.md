# About this book

This book, "Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming", was first published in 1992.
The rights reverted to the author, Peter Norvig, who decided to share it under the MIT license; it's open source, but not public domain.

There's a collaborative effort to dust it off, fix it up, and bring it online.
We're working on this in public, together, at our Github repo, [https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp](https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp) .
Look for updates and newer versions there.
You can send in corrections and issues there, or email them to
